# python-chatbot-autoliker
Hello there, I am not a coder and don't even know how to code haha, but I have seen chatbots and autolikers for tinder, where people basically just sit back and let the chatbot do its work. I was wondering if you can do the same thing, but for this app called "Wizz- Make New Friends". The reason why is because I basically use this app to grow my instagram page, which comprises around basketball, but I don't want to do it manually continously. Is there a way to create a trained chatbot to interact with people automatically, and a autoliker that basically always swipes right for this app called "Wizz- Make New Friends". Thank you very much! And if you would like to contact me on my instagram, it is @Dimsumtootsie! Ps. If you want some kind of... i guess.... cash reward.... I'm happy to do so!!! i would just have to keep earning gift cards through surveys because im a 16 year old and broke haha! Thank you guys!
